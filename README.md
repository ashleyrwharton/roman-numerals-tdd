# Fizzbuzz TDD Exercise

We want a function that accepts a parameter N and returns an array of the numbers from 1 to N

Howeverâ€¦
- Numbers that are multiples of 3 should be replaced with "Fizz"
- Numbers that are multiples of 5 should be replaced with "Buzz"
- Numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 should be replaced with "FizzBuzz"

You should aim to develop this functionality using a TDD approach.

## Setup

1. Ensure NodeJS is installed
2. Install the node dependencies

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

## Testing

Tests should be written in the `test/test.js` file.

To run the test script:
    ```
    $ npm test
    ```

## Developing

Development should be done within the `fizzbuzz.js` file.
